1. Run the unit testing program to ensure that your program runs as expected.
    
    For Linux and Mac users
    ```
    ./test.sh or source ./test.sh
    ```
       
    For windows users
    ```
    ./win_test.bat
    ```
       
    The unit testing will output the results of a series of tests using specific input and expected output.  Any error will provide information on where the expected output is different from the actual output.  You will need to edit your source code to fix the error and run `./test.sh` or `./win_test.bat` repeatedly until it passes all the test.

## Submission

Submit a zip file containing all the code files on canvas 

Naming Convention: <CWID>_<LastName>.zip    

Your zipped folder should contain below files:
```
CWID_LASTNAME.zip -
                  | > test.py
                  | > test.sh
                  | > main.py
                  | > people.py
                  | > test.txt
                  | > win_test.bat
```
