## Getting Started

1. Setting Up Python Environment

     - Verify Python Installation:
     - Open your terminal (Command Prompt for Windows, Terminal for macOS/Linux).
     - Type python --version and press Enter.
     - You should see the installed Python version displayed.

2. Configuring Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

     - Install Python Extension:
     - Open VS Code.
     - Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+X.
     - Search for “Python” in the Extensions Marketplace.
     - Click “Install” on the Python extension by Microsoft.

3. Running Python in VS Code

     - Create a New Python File:
     - In VS Code, open a folder where you want to save your Python projects.
     - Click on File > New File or press Ctrl+N to create a new file.
     - Save the file with a .py extension (e.g., hello.py).
     
## Program Instructions
1. Write a Python program that performs as a Tuffy Titan Contact List which contains a list of contacts that can be modified or deleted.

1. Create a `contacts` module to meet the following requirements:
     1. Create a file named `contacts.py`.
     1. Add a comment at the top of the file which indicates your name, date and the purpose of the file.
     1. Note: All contact dictionaries within this module should assume a dictionary of the form: `{id: ['first', 'last'], id: ['first', 'last'], id: ['first', 'last']...}` where the id will be the phone number in this exercise.
     1. Note: All functions should implement a docstring with a simple sentence that describes the function.


     1. Define a function named `add_contact` to meet the following requirements:
          1. Take a contact dictionary as a positional parameter.
          1. Take a `id` as a keyword parameter.
          1. Take a `first_name` as a keyword parameter.
          1. Take a `last_name` as a keyword parameter.
          2. If the id exists in the dictionary, return the string `error`.
          3. Append the id:[first_name, last_name] key:value pair to the contact dictionary.
          4. Return the key:value pair that was added.


     1. Define a function named `modify_contact` to meet the following requirements:
          1. Take a contact dictionary as a positional parameter.
          1. Take a `id` as a keyword parameter.
          1. Take a `first_name` as a keyword parameter.
          1. Take a `last_name` as a keyword parameter.
          1. If the id does not exists in the dictionary, return the string `error`.
          1. Append the id:[first_name, last_name] key:value pair to the contact dictionary.
          1. Return the key:value pair that was added.


     1. Define a function named `delete_contact` to meet the following requirements:
          1. Take a contact dictionary as a positional parameter.
          1. Take a `id` as a keyword parameter.
          2. If the id does not exists in the dictionary, return the string `error`.
          3. Remove the key:value pair with the key equal to id.
          3. Return the key:value pair with the key equal to id.


     1. Define a function named `sort_contacts` to meet the following requirements:
          1. Take a contact dictionary as a positional parameter.
          2. Sort the dictionary in ascending order by last name, and then by first name, ignoring case.
          3. Return the sorted dictionary. 


     1. Define a function named `find_contact` to meet the following requirements:
          1. Take a contact dictionary as a positional parameter.
          1. Take a `find` as a keyword parameter.
          2. Create an empty dictionary.
          3. If find is a numeric value and contained as a key in the dictionary, add the key:value pair to the created dictionary.
          4. Loop through all the key:value pairs and if the find substring is contained in either the first name or last name, add the key:value pair to the created dictionary.
          5. Sort the created dictionary in ascending order by last name, and then by first name, ignoring case.
          6. Return the created dictionary. 

          
1. Create a `main` driver program to meet the following requirements:
     1. Create a file named `main.py`.
     1. Add a comment at the top of the file which indicates your name, date and the purpose of the file.
     1. Import the `contacts` module.
     2. Define a variable to use for the contact dictionary. 
     3. Implement a menu within a loop with following choices:
          1. Add contact
          1. Modify contact
          1. Delete contact
          1. Print contact list (sorted)
          1. Find contact
          1. Exit the program
     4. Prompt the user for the menu choice.
     5. Prompt the user for the information needed for the appropriate `contacts` function and call the function.
     6. Print out appropriate errors with function return values of `error`.
1. Run the program using the command below and repeat the steps above until you are satisfied your program output meets the above requirements.

    ```
    python3 -m main
    ```


1. Typical input and output for the program:
     ```

     ```

1. Run the unit testing program to ensure that your program runs as expected.
    
    For Linux and Mac users
    ```
    ./test.sh or source ./test.sh
    ```
       
    For windows users
    ```
    ./win_test.bat
    ```
       
    The unit testing will output the results of a series of tests using specific input and expected output.  Any error will provide information on where the expected output is different from the actual output.  You will need to edit your source code to fix the error and run `./test.sh` or `./win_test.bat` repeatedly until it passes all the test.

## Submission

Submit a zip file containing all the code files on canvas 

Naming Convention: <CWID>_<LastName>.zip    

Your zipped folder should contain below files:
```
CWID_LASTNAME.zip -
                  | > test.py
                  | > test.sh
                  | > main.py
                  | > contacts.py
                  | > test.txt
                  | > win_test.bat
```
